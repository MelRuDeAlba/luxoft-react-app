      <p>
        The basic concept of the Secret Santa game is simple.
        All of the participants' names are placed into a hat, box, etc. ...
        When the gift-giving time arrives, each recipient finds his/her gift and must guess who their Secret Santa is.
        If they can't guess, their Secret Santa eventually confesses.
